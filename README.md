# CS426 @UIC: Assignment 1 (Living in The City)
I developed a 3D ball-throwing game where players control a droid tasked with scaring away mysterious UFOs that appear at night over the city. This game's objective is to shoot down the 5 faintly glowing UFOs that can be found by exploring the small area of the city. Though, since it's at night, players will have to utilize the droid's built in flashlight to navigate the city!
